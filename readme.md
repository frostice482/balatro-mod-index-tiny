This is a tiny version of https://github.com/skyline69/balatro-mod-index.
The index repo contains lots of `thumbnail.jpg` files, which fills up the repo size significantly.
This repo aims to reduce the repo size by not including the `thumbnail.jpg` by default, and reducing API calls by bundling mod metadata to one file.
